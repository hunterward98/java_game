=== Quick Wins (Simple Enums/Data Classes) ===

Enums to test:
  ✓ io.github.inherit_this.audio.SoundType (tested)
  ✓ io.github.inherit_this.entities.InteractableType (tested)
  ✓ io.github.inherit_this.entities.NPCType (tested)
  ✓ io.github.inherit_this.items.EquipmentSlot (tested)
  ✓ io.github.inherit_this.items.ItemRarity (tested)
  ✓ io.github.inherit_this.items.ItemType (tested)
  ✓ io.github.inherit_this.world.TileLayer (tested)
  ✓ io.github.inherit_this.world.TileType (tested)

=== Recommendations ===
1. Focus on enums without tests (marked with ✗ above)
2. Test data classes in high-priority packages
3. Avoid classes with LibGDX dependencies (Texture, FileHandle, etc.)
